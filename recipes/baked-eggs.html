    <h1>Chef John's Baked Eggs</h1>
        <p>If you enjoy huevos rancheros, you will love this. The way the spicy sauce mingles with just barely set eggs is very similar, and when you start scooping this up with toasted chunks of bread, it gets borderline magical.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup marinara sauce</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream</li>
