# The Odin Project

Stared learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript from scratch using [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) website. This is a fist project to demonstrate what I have learned so far.


## Update 1 - HTML

### HTML Structure

In this project, the initial focus is on utilizing HTML to establish the fundamental structure. The objective is to create files and folders, forming the core structure of a recipe website. Each recipe will have its dedicated page, contributing to a total of three pages. Additionally, an image folder is included to store images associated with the recipes.

While I had prior experience and had created similar sites through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), the [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) offered a valuable insight into the hierarchical organization of files when writing paths. This aspect, which I may have overlooked previously, became more apparent during my work with Odin, enhancing my understanding of HTML file structures.
